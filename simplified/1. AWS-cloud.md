**1. What is cloud computing?**  
Cloud computing means using the internet to access and store data, applications, and services on remote servers instead of on your local computer. It allows businesses to use computing resources on-demand, like storage and processing power, without managing physical hardware.

**2. What are the different types of cloud services?**  
Cloud services are typically divided into three types:
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides virtualized computing resources like servers and storage.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Offers a platform to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with infrastructure.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Delivers software applications over the internet, like email or document editing tools.

**3. What are the various types of cloud deployment models?**  
There are three main cloud deployment models:
- **Public Cloud:** Services are delivered over the internet and shared across multiple organizations (e.g., AWS, Azure).
- **Private Cloud:** Used exclusively by one organization, offering more control and privacy.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them.

**4. What is AWS, and what are its key services?**  
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud platform that offers a wide range of services like:
- **EC2** for virtual servers,
- **S3** for storage,
- **RDS** for managed databases,
- **Lambda** for serverless computing.

It helps businesses build, deploy, and manage applications more efficiently.

**5. How does AWS pricing work?**  
AWS pricing is based on a **pay-as-you-go** model, meaning you pay only for the resources you use, like compute time, storage, and data transfer. There are no upfront costs, and you can scale resources up or down as needed.

**6. What are the benefits of using AWS?**  
Benefits of using AWS include:
- **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Pay only for what you use.
- **Global reach:** Data centers worldwide for low-latency access.
- **Security:** Strong security measures to protect data.

**7. Can you explain the AWS shared responsibility model?**  
In AWS, security is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer:
- **AWS** manages the security of the cloud (physical infrastructure, networking).
- **Customers** manage security in the cloud (data, applications, user access).

**8. What is the AWS free tier, and what does it include?**  
The **AWS Free Tier** provides limited access to AWS services for free to help new users get started. It includes:
- **750 hours of EC2** usage per month,
- **5 GB of S3 storage,**
- Access to services like Lambda, RDS, and DynamoDB within specific usage limits.

**9. How do you secure data in the cloud?**  
To secure data in the cloud, you can:
- Use **encryption** for data in transit and at rest.
- Implement **access controls** with IAM (Identity and Access Management).
- Regularly update and patch systems.
- Monitor and audit logs for suspicious activities.

**10. What is the difference between public, private, and hybrid clouds?**  
- **Public Cloud:** Shared resources managed by a third-party provider (e.g., AWS).
- **Private Cloud:** Dedicated resources for a single organization, offering more control.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** A mix of both, allowing for flexibility and optimized workload distribution.
