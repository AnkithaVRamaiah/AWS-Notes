**41. What are EC2 instance types?**  
**EC2 instance types** are categorized based on different combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. Examples include **General Purpose** (e.g., t3, m5), **Compute Optimized** (e.g., c5), **Memory Optimized** (e.g., r5), **Storage Optimized** (e.g., i3), and **GPU Instances** (e.g., p3).

1. Stop the instance.
2. In the AWS Management Console, go to **Instances**.
3. Select the instance and choose **Actions > Instance Settings > Change Instance Type**.
4. Select the new instance type, then start the instance.

**44. What are the different load balancers in AWS?**  
AWS offers three types of **load balancers**:
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Best for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Best for handling TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic.
- **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**: Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP traffic, used mainly for legacy applications.

**45. How do you configure auto-scaling in AWS?**  
To configure **auto-scaling**:
1. Create a **Launch Configuration** or **Launch Template** specifying the instance details.
2. Define an **Auto Scaling Group** with the desired capacity and scaling policies.
3. Set up scaling policies based on metrics like CPU usage, or use **target tracking scaling** for automatic adjustments.

**46. What are spot instances, and when would you use them?**  
**Spot instances** are spare EC2 capacity offered at a discount. They are ideal for **batch processing, data analysis, or any workload that can handle interruptions**, as AWS can reclaim the instance with short notice.

**47. What is an AMI?**  
An **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** is a template that contains the software configuration (OS, application server, and applications) needed to launch an EC2 instance. It allows you to quickly spin up instances with pre-configured environments.

**48. How do you create a custom AMI?**  
To create a custom AMI:
1. Configure your instance with the required software and settings.
2. Go to the AWS Management Console, select the instance, and choose **Actions > Image > Create Image**.
3. Provide a name and optional description, then click **Create Image**.

**49. What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?**  
**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is a platform as a service (PaaS) that simplifies the deployment and management of applications. You just upload your code, and Beanstalk handles the provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and monitoring.

**50. What are EC2 instance storage options?**  
EC2 offers several **storage options**:
- **Instance Store**: Temporary, ephemeral storage tied to the lifecycle of the instance.
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: Persistent storage that can be attached or detached from instances.
- **EFS (Elastic File System)**: Scalable file storage for multiple instances.
- **S3**: Object storage for long-term, scalable storage needs.
