**65. How do you back up RDS databases?**  
To back up an **RDS database**:
1. Enable **automatic backups** during the creation of the RDS instance (AWS retains backups for a specified retention period).
2. For manual backups, create a **DB snapshot** in the RDS console.
3. You can restore the database from snapshots at any time.

**66. What are read replicas in RDS?**  
**Read replicas** are copies of an RDS database instance that can be used for read-heavy workloads. They help offload read traffic from the primary database, improving performance and scalability.

**67. What is the difference between RDS and DynamoDB?**  
- **RDS**: A managed relational database service for structured data with support for SQL-based queries.
- **DynamoDB**: A managed NoSQL database service for highly scalable, low-latency workloads that do not require complex queries or joins.

---

**68. How do you scale RDS instances?**  
You can scale an **RDS instance** by:
1. **Vertically scaling**: Changing the instance type to a larger one for more CPU, RAM, or storage.
2. **Horizontally scaling**: Adding **read replicas** or using **multi-AZ** deployments for high availability and read scaling.

**69. What is Aurora in AWS?**  
**Amazon Aurora** is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database service with high performance and availability. It is designed for cloud environments and provides up to 5 times better performance than MySQL with automatic scaling and replication.

---

**70. How do you configure multi-AZ deployments in RDS?**  
To configure **multi-AZ deployments** in RDS:
1. During the creation of the RDS instance, select the **Multi-AZ deployment** option.
2. AWS automatically provisions a primary DB instance and a synchronous standby replica in another Availability Zone for failover purposes.
