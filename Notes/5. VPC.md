# AWS VPC Components Explained :

### **Internet Gateway (IGW):**
An **Internet Gateway** connects your **VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud) to the internet. It allows resources in the **public subnet**, like web servers, to send and receive data from the internet. However, for security, only outbound internet traffic is allowed by default unless you configure it to allow inbound traffic.

### **Route 53:**
**Route 53** is AWS’s **DNS service**. It maps domain names, like **www.myapp.com**, to IP addresses. This helps direct user requests to the correct **load balancer** or **EC2 instance** in the VPC. It also performs **health checks** to ensure traffic goes to healthy resources, improving availability and performance.

### **Public Subnet:**
A **public subnet** is a subnet in the VPC that has a route to the **Internet Gateway**. It’s used for resources, such as web servers, that need internet access. Since these resources are exposed to the internet, **security groups** and **NACLs** (Network Access Control Lists) are crucial to protect them.

### **Private Subnet:**
A **private subnet** doesn’t have a direct route to the **Internet Gateway**. It’s typically used for backend resources like **databases** or **application servers** that don’t need to be accessed directly from the internet. Instead, these resources communicate internally or use a **NAT Gateway** for outbound internet access.

### **Load Balancer:**
A **Load Balancer** distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure **high availability** and **fault tolerance**. For example, an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** handles HTTP/HTTPS traffic and is usually placed in the public subnet to handle requests from the internet, then routes them to instances in public or private subnets.

### **Route Table:**
A **Route Table** contains rules that decide where network traffic is directed within the VPC. Each subnet has a route table. For example, public subnets have a route to the **Internet Gateway**, while private subnets might route traffic to a **NAT Gateway**.

### **Security Group:**
A **Security Group** acts as a **firewall** for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic. For example, you can allow HTTP traffic from the internet but deny all other traffic. Security groups are attached directly to instances and can be updated anytime.

### **Subnet:**
A **Subnet** is a segment within the VPC’s IP address range where you launch AWS resources. Subnets can be public or private, based on the route table they’re associated with. They help organize resources and enhance security.

### **Network Access Control List (NACL):**
A **NACL** is a stateless firewall at the subnet level, controlling traffic to and from the subnet. Unlike security groups, NACLs can explicitly allow or deny specific types of traffic and are evaluated in order.

### **NAT Gateway/Instance:**
A **NAT Gateway** or **NAT Instance** provides internet access for instances in a **private subnet**. It routes their traffic to the **Internet Gateway**, allowing these instances to access the internet for updates or external services while keeping them hidden from inbound internet traffic.

### Flow of a User Request in AWS VPC

1. **User Makes a Request**:
   - A user opens their browser and enters `www.myapp.com`. This triggers a request to resolve this domain name into an IP address.

2. **DNS Resolution with Route 53**:
   - **Route 53**, AWS’s DNS service, receives this request and resolves `www.myapp.com` to the public IP address of the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
   - The user's browser now knows where to send the HTTP/HTTPS request to reach your application.

3. **Traffic Enters the VPC through Internet Gateway**:
   - The request from the user's browser is sent over the internet to the **Internet Gateway (IGW)** of your VPC.
   - The **Internet Gateway** acts as the entry point to your VPC for this request.

4. **Route to Public Subnet**:
   - The **Route Table** associated with the **public subnet** contains a route directing the request to the **ALB**, which is placed in this public subnet.
   - The **Internet Gateway** routes the request to the **Load Balancer**.

5. **Load Balancer Distributes Traffic**:
   - The **ALB** examines the incoming request and uses its load-balancing algorithm to decide which **EC2 instance** (web server) should handle the request.
   - The **ALB** forwards the request to an **EC2 instance** running in either a **public subnet** or a **private subnet**.

6. **Security Group Checks**:
   - Before the request reaches the **EC2 instance**, the **Security Group** associated with the instance checks if the request is allowed based on configured rules (e.g., allowing HTTP/HTTPS traffic).
   - If the rules permit, the request reaches the **web server** on the **EC2 instance**.

7. **Web Server Processes Request**:
   - The **web server** processes the incoming request. If it requires data from a **database**, the server makes a query to the **database instance** hosted in a **private subnet**.
   - This communication is allowed because the **Security Group** attached to the web server permits it to access the database.

8. **Database Query and Response**:
   - The **database server**, secured in the **private subnet**, processes the query and sends the required data back to the **web server**.
   - The **Security Group** and **NACLs** ensure only specific traffic can enter and exit the **private subnet**.

9. **Outgoing Internet Traffic via NAT Gateway**:
   - If the **web server** or **database server** needs to make an external API call (e.g., fetching updates or communicating with third-party services), this traffic goes through a **NAT Gateway**.
   - The **NAT Gateway**, residing in the **public subnet**, enables the **private subnet** instances to send outbound traffic to the internet without exposing them to inbound internet traffic.

10. **Returning Response to User**:
    - Once the **web server** has processed the request and received any necessary data, it sends the response back to the **ALB**.
    - The **ALB** forwards this response to the user's browser via the **Internet Gateway**.

11. **Route Table and NACLs Ensure Security**:
    - The **Route Table** ensures all traffic flows correctly within the VPC.
    - **NACLs** (Network Access Control Lists) at the subnet level provide an extra layer of stateless security, ensuring only the allowed traffic can pass through the subnets.

12. **User Receives the Response**:
    - The user’s browser receives the response from your application, and the page loads successfully.

### Key Additional Components in Flow:

- **NAT Gateway**:
  - Allows instances in the **private subnet** to access the internet without allowing direct inbound internet traffic to those instances.
  
- **Load Balancer**:
  - Balances incoming traffic across multiple instances for scalability and fault tolerance.
  
- **NACLs**:
  - Provide a subnet-level security mechanism, controlling inbound and outbound traffic. NACLs are stateless, so they require rules for both directions of traffic.
