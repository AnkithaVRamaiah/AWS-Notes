# **AWS Load Balancers – Complete Notes with Examples**

## **Introduction to Load Balancing**
Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. It improves **availability, reliability, and scalability** of applications.

AWS provides **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**, which automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple **EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses**.

## **Types of AWS Load Balancers**
AWS offers **four types** of load balancers:

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
3. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**
4. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** *(Older generation, not recommended for new applications)*

---

## **1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
ALB is designed for **HTTP(S) and WebSocket traffic**. It operates at **Layer 7 (Application Layer)** and provides **intelligent routing** based on content.

### **Features of ALB**
✅ **Content-Based Routing** → Routes requests based on URL path, headers, query parameters.  
✅ **Host-Based Routing** → Directs traffic to different backend services based on domain names.  
✅ **Path-Based Routing** → Routes traffic based on the URL path (e.g., `/api` vs. `/images`).  
✅ **Supports Containers (ECS, EKS)** → Can route traffic to multiple containers using dynamic port mapping.  
✅ **WebSockets Support** → Used for real-time applications like chat applications.  
✅ **Authentication & Security** → Supports AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) & user authentication.  
✅ **Automatic Scaling** → Scales based on demand using **Auto Scaling Groups**.  

### **Example Use Case of ALB**
**Scenario:**  
A web application has **two services**:
1. `/api` → Backend API
2. `/static` → Frontend static content

**Solution:**
- **ALB** directs API requests to one set of EC2 instances and frontend requests to another.
- Uses **Path-Based Routing**:
  - `example.com/api` → Routes to **Backend EC2 instances**
  - `example.com/static` → Routes to **Frontend EC2 instances**

### **When to Use ALB?**
✔ Web applications with **multiple microservices** (APIs, frontend, backend).  
✔ Applications requiring **user authentication** (OAuth, Cognito, etc.).  
✔ Services using **containers (ECS, EKS, Fargate)**.  
✔ When you need **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** for security.  

---

## **2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
NLB is designed for **high-performance and low-latency applications**. It operates at **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)** and handles **millions of requests per second**.

### **Features of NLB**
✅ **TCP, UDP, TLS Support** → Ideal for applications requiring **low latency** (e.g., gaming, real-time streaming).  
✅ **Static IP Address** → Unlike ALB, NLB provides **fixed IP addresses**.  
✅ **Preserves Source IP** → Allows backend servers to see the real client IP address.  
✅ **Cross-Zone Load Balancing** → Distributes traffic across multiple **AWS Availability Zones (AZs)**.  
✅ **Supports AWS PrivateLink** → Connects applications privately inside AWS.  

### **Example Use Case of NLB**
**Scenario:**  
A **high-performance stock trading system** requires a load balancer that can handle **millions of TCP requests per second**.

**Solution:**  
- **NLB** distributes TCP connections to multiple backend servers.  
- It ensures **low latency and high throughput**.  
- Uses a **Static IP Address** for consistent DNS resolution.  

### **When to Use NLB?**
✔ Applications requiring **TCP/UDP traffic** (e.g., DNS servers, gaming applications).  
✔ **High-performance applications** needing ultra-low latency.  
✔ Applications needing a **fixed IP address** for whitelisting (e.g., enterprise apps).  
✔ **Internal AWS services using AWS PrivateLink**.

## **3. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**
GWLB is used for **network appliances like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and security tools**. It operates at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**.

### **Features of GWLB**
✅ **Transparent Load Balancing** → Routes traffic without modifying packets.  
✅ **Supports Security Appliances** → Used for firewalls, threat monitoring.  
✅ **High Availability** → Automatically distributes traffic across multiple **security appliances**.  
✅ **Works with AWS Transit Gateway** → Routes traffic to **firewalls across multiple VPCs**.  

### **Example Use Case of GWLB**
**Scenario:**  
A company wants to **inspect incoming traffic** using a **firewall before it reaches EC2 instances**.

**Solution:**  
- **GWLB** sends all traffic through a **firewall appliance** before forwarding it to backend servers.  
- Ensures **security and compliance** in the AWS environment.  

### **When to Use GWLB?**
✔ When using **third-party security appliances** (firewalls, IDS/IPS, packet inspection).  
✔ **Security and compliance** requirements demand **traffic filtering**.  
✔ Need to inspect **east-west and north-south traffic** in a multi-VPC setup.

## **4. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**
CLB is the **older generation** of load balancers and operates at **both Layer 4 & Layer 7**.  
It **lacks modern features** and is **not recommended for new applications**.

### **Features of CLB**
✅ Supports **basic load balancing** for HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP applications.  
✅ **Sticky Sessions (Session Persistence)** using cookies.  
✅ **Health Checks** to ensure traffic is sent to healthy instances.  

### **Example Use Case of CLB**
**Scenario:**  
A **legacy application** built on EC2 instances requires **session persistence**.

**Solution:**  
- **CLB** is used to distribute traffic, ensuring **sticky sessions** for session-based applications.  

### **When to Use CLB?**
✔ Only for **legacy applications** that already use CLB.  
❌ Not recommended for new applications (use ALB or NLB instead).
