### **Cloud Computing:**
**Cloud computing** is like renting computing resources over the internet instead of owning physical servers. It allows you to access servers, storage, databases, and a variety of services on-demand, and you pay only for what you use. This means you can scale up or down easily based on your needs, without worrying about hardware maintenance or upfront costs.

For example, if you need more servers during a big sale or launch, you can quickly add more in the cloud and reduce them after the traffic slows down. This flexibility makes cloud computing cost-effective and efficient.

### **AWS (Amazon Web Services):**
**AWS** is one of the leading **cloud service providers**, offering a wide range of services like computing power (**EC2**), storage (**S3**), databases (**RDS**), and more. AWS helps businesses of all sizes deploy applications faster and manage infrastructure more efficiently.

With AWS, you can:
- **Launch virtual servers** (EC2) to run applications.
- **Store data** securely with services like S3.
- **Scale resources** up or down based on your applicationâ€™s demand.
- Use managed services to handle databases, machine learning, analytics, and more.

For instance, if you are building a web application, you can use **EC2** for servers, **RDS** for databases, and **S3** for storing user files, all without buying any physical hardware.
