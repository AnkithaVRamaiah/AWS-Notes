**Amazon Route 53** is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It helps route traffic to your website or application by translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.

### How it works:
1. **Domain Registration**: First, you register a domain name (like example.com) using Route 53 or another domain registrar.
   
2. **DNS Records**: Once your domain is registered, you create **DNS records** (like A, CNAME, MX, etc.) in Route 53. These records tell Route 53 how to direct traffic to your servers or services.

3. **Traffic Routing**: When someone types your domain name in their browser, a DNS query is sent to Route 53. Based on the records you set, Route 53 responds with the appropriate IP address.

4. **Health Checks**: Route 53 can also monitor the health of your resources (like a web server). If a resource goes down, it can automatically route traffic to a healthy server or location.
