### **Cloud Models:**

1. **Public Cloud:**
   In a **public cloud**, services are offered over the internet by third-party providers like **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud**. Anyone can use these services on a pay-as-you-go basis. Itâ€™s cost-effective and scalable, making it ideal for startups or businesses without large infrastructure budgets.

2. **Private Cloud:**
   A **private cloud** is used exclusively by one organization. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. It offers more control and security, which is suitable for organizations with strict compliance or security requirements.

3. **Hybrid Cloud:**
   A **hybrid cloud** combines **public** and **private** clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This provides more flexibility, enabling organizations to keep sensitive data in the private cloud while using the public cloud for less critical resources or burst capacity.

### **Cloud Service Models:**

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
   **IaaS** provides the basic building blocks like virtual servers, storage, and networking. You manage the operating system and applications, while the cloud provider handles the hardware. Examples include **AWS EC2** and **Azure Virtual Machines**.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
   **PaaS** provides a platform to develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. You focus on your code, and the provider manages everything else. Examples are **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** and **Google App Engine**.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):**
   **SaaS** delivers software applications over the internet. Users access these applications through a web browser, and the provider handles everything from infrastructure to application updates. Examples include **Google Workspace** and **Salesforce**.
