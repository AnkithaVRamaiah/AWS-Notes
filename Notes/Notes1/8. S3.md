### **S3 Storage Pricing & How to Upload Files**  

---

## **1️⃣ S3 Pricing (Pay-as-You-Go Model)**
Amazon S3 charges you based on:  
✅ **Storage Used** – How much data you store  
✅ **Requests & Data Transfer** – How often you access/move files  
✅ **Storage Class** – Different pricing for different storage needs  

### **S3 Storage Classes & Cost**  
| **Storage Class**       | **Use Case**                  | **Pricing (Approx.)** |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **S3 Standard**         | Frequently accessed data     | Highest cost         |
| **S3 Infrequent Access (IA)** | Less accessed files (monthly) | 40% cheaper than Standard |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**      | Cheaper but stores in one zone | Lower cost than IA |
| **S3 Glacier**          | Cold storage (rarely accessed) | Very cheap (long retrieval time) |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** | Long-term archival (years) | Cheapest (takes hours to retrieve) |

💡 **Example:**  
- Storing **100GB in S3 Standard** = ~$2.30/month  
- Storing **100GB in Glacier** = ~$0.10/month  

👉 **Tip:** If you don’t need frequent access, use **Glacier** to save costs!

---
### **How to Access Files in S3?** 🚀  
Once you upload files to Amazon S3, you can access them in different ways depending on your needs.  

---

## **1️⃣ Access via AWS Management Console (Easiest)**  
1️⃣ **Go to AWS Console** → Open **S3**  
2️⃣ **Find your bucket** → Click on it  
3️⃣ Click on the file you want to access  
4️⃣ Copy the **Object URL** (if public) or **Download** the file  

🔹 **Example Public URL:**  
`https://my-data-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/myfile.jpg`  
💡 *This only works if the file is public!*

---

## **2️⃣ Access via AWS CLI (For Developers)**  
If you have **AWS CLI** installed, run:  

📌 **List files in a bucket:**  
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://my-data-bucket/
```
📌 **Download a file from S3:**  
```bash
aws s3 cp s3://my-data-bucket/myfile.txt .
```
📌 **Make a file public:**  
```bash
aws s3api put-object-acl --bucket my-data-bucket --key myfile.txt --acl public-read
```

---

## **3️⃣ Access via AWS SDK (For Programmers)**
If you’re using **Python (Boto3)**:
```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
s3.download_file('my-data-bucket', 'myfile.txt', 'downloaded_file.txt')
```
For **Node.js, Java, PHP**, similar SDKs exist.

---

## **4️⃣ Access via Presigned URLs (Temporary Links)**
If your file is **private**, you can generate a **temporary access link**:

🔹 **Example in Python (Boto3):**
```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
url = s3.generate_presigned_url('get_object', 
                                Params={'Bucket': 'my-data-bucket', 'Key': 'myfile.txt'}, 
                                ExpiresIn=3600)  # Link valid for 1 hour
print(url)
```
📌 This method is great for **secure, time-limited access**.

---

## **5️⃣ Access via Static Website Hosting (For Websites)**
1️⃣ Enable **Static Website Hosting** in S3  
2️⃣ Set **public read permissions** for files  
3️⃣ Access your files via the **website endpoint**  

🔹 **Example URL:**  
`http://my-data-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html`

---

### **Static Website Hosting in S3** 🚀  
Amazon S3 can host a **static website**, meaning a site that consists of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files** (but no server-side code like PHP or databases).  

👉 It’s great for hosting **personal blogs, landing pages, portfolios, or simple web apps**.

---

## **1️⃣ How Static Hosting Works in S3?**  
✅ **S3 stores your website files** (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.)  
✅ You enable **Static Website Hosting** in S3  
✅ S3 provides a **website URL** like:  
   `http://my-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/`  
✅ Users can visit this link to access your site  

---

## **2️⃣ Steps to Enable Static Website Hosting in S3**  

### **📌 Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket**  
1️⃣ Open **AWS Console** → Go to **S3**  
2️⃣ Click **"Create Bucket"**  
3️⃣ **Bucket name**: Must be **unique** (e.g., `my-static-site`)  
4️⃣ **Disable Block Public Access** (so users can view your site)  

---

### **📌 Step 2: Upload Website Files**  
1️⃣ Open your **S3 bucket**  
2️⃣ Click **"Upload"** → Add your `index.html`, `style.css`, etc.

5️⃣ Click **Save**  
6️⃣ Copy the **Website URL** (shown in settings)  

---

### **📌 Step 4: Set Permissions (Make Files Public)**  
By default, S3 files are **private**, so:  
1️⃣ Go to **Permissions** → **Bucket Policy**  
2️⃣ Paste this **public read policy**:  

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-static-site/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
✅ Replace `my-static-site` with **your bucket name**  
✅ Click **Save**  

---

### **3️⃣ Access Your Website! 🎉**  
Now, you can visit your **S3 Website URL**:  
`http://my-static-site.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/`  

💡 **Want a custom domain?** Use **Route 53 & CloudFront** to link a domain like `www.mysite.com` to your S3 site.

✖️ Can’t run dynamic applications (like WordPress)  

---

## **Bucket Policy in S3: Why, When & How?** 🚀  

### **1️⃣ What is an S3 Bucket Policy?**  
An **S3 Bucket Policy** is a set of rules (written in JSON) that controls **who can access your S3 bucket and what actions they can perform** (e.g., read, write, delete files).  

It’s like setting permissions on a **shared Google Drive folder**, but for your S3 bucket.

---

### **2️⃣ Why is a Bucket Policy Important?**  

✅ **Security** – Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access  
✅ **Public Access Control** – Allows/denies public access to files  
✅ **Granular Permissions** – Controls access at the **bucket** or **file level**  
✅ **Automation** – Helps in **automating access** for apps & services  

---

### **3️⃣ When to Use a Bucket Policy?**  

✔️ **Making a Static Website Public** – Allow anyone to read your HTML/CSS/JS files  
✔️ **Restricting Access to a Specific User/Role** – E.g., Only allow an IAM user to upload files  
✔️ **Denying Access to a Specific IP Address** – E.g., Block access from certain locations  
✔️ **Enforcing Encryption** – Ensure all files are uploaded with encryption  

---

### **4️⃣ How to Use a Bucket Policy? (Step-by-Step)**  

### **📌 Step 1: Open the Bucket Policy Editor**  
1️⃣ Go to **AWS Console** → Open **S3**  
2️⃣ Select your **bucket**  
3️⃣ Click on **Permissions** → Scroll to **Bucket Policy**  
4️⃣ Click **Edit**  

---

### **📌 Step 2: Add a Policy Based on Your Use Case**  

#### **✅ Example 1: Make All Files Public (For Static Website Hosting)**  
This allows **anyone** (`Principal: "*"`) to read (`s3:GetObject`) files in the bucket:  

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
✅ Replace **`my-bucket-name`** with your actual bucket name.  

---

#### **✅ Example 2: Allow Only a Specific IAM User to Upload Files**  
This allows **only one IAM user** (identified by their AWS ARN) to upload files:  

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowSpecificUserUpload",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/my-user"
      },
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
✅ Replace `"123456789012:user/my-user"` with the actual **IAM user ARN**  

---

#### **✅ Example 3: Block All Public Access (Extra Security)**  
This policy **denies** all access to **everyone**, even if files are marked public:  

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyPublicAccess",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

#### **✅ Example 4: Restrict Access to Specific IP Addresses**  
This allows only users from **a specific IP range** (e.g., an office network) to access files:  

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowOnlySpecificIP",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*",
      "Condition": {
        "NotIpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
✅ Replace **`203.0.113.0/24`** with your allowed IP range  

---

### **📌 Step 3: Save & Test Your Policy**
1️⃣ Click **Save Changes**  
2️⃣ Try accessing the bucket using AWS Console, CLI, or a browser  
3️⃣ If needed, **modify the policy** to allow/restrict access further  

---

### **5️⃣ Additional Tips on Bucket Policies**  

✅ **Use IAM Roles Instead of Public Access** – It’s more secure  
✅ **Enable Server Access Logging** – Track who accessed your files  
✅ **Use AWS Policy Generator** – Helps create bucket policies easily ([AWS Policy Generator](https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html))  
✅ **Test with IAM Policy Simulator** – See if your policy works before applying it  

---

### **Controlling Access to S3 Files (Public, IAM, & CORS Settings)** 🚀  

When you store files in **Amazon S3**, they are **private by default**. If you want to share them or allow specific access, you need to configure **permissions, IAM roles, and CORS policies**.  

---

## **1️⃣ Public Access Settings (Make a File Public)**
By default, S3 **blocks public access** for security. But you can make files public if needed.  

### **🔹 Method 1: AWS Console (Easiest)**
1️⃣ Go to **AWS Console → S3**  
2️⃣ Open your bucket → Click on a file  
3️⃣ Go to **Permissions** tab  
4️⃣ Click **"Public access settings"** → Disable block public access  
5️⃣ Click **"ACL" (Access Control List)** → Set to **public-read**  

✅ Now your file is publicly accessible via its **Object URL**  
🔹 Example: `https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/myfile.jpg`

💡 **⚠ Warning**: Making files public means **anyone** can access them! Use IAM roles for better control.

---

## **2️⃣ IAM Permissions (For Private Access)**
If you want **only specific users** to access files, use **IAM Policies**.  

### **🔹 Example IAM Policy (Allow User to Read from a Specific Bucket)**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-data-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
✅ Attach this policy to an **IAM User or Role** to grant read access.

💡 **Tip**: To allow full access, replace `"s3:GetObject"` with `"s3:*"`.

---

## **3️⃣ Presigned URLs (Temporary Secure Access)**
If a file is private but you want to share it **temporarily**, generate a **presigned URL**.

🔹 **Python (Boto3) Example:**
```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
url = s3.generate_presigned_url('get_object',
                                Params={'Bucket': 'my-data-bucket', 'Key': 'myfile.txt'},
                                ExpiresIn=3600)  # Link valid for 1 hour
print(url)
```
✅ This creates a **temporary access link** that expires after 1 hour.

---

## **4️⃣ CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
If you want to **allow access from a different domain** (e.g., a website fetching images from S3), set up a **CORS Policy**.

### **🔹 Example CORS Policy (Allow Any Website to Access Your Files)**
1️⃣ Go to **AWS Console → S3**  
2️⃣ Select your bucket → Click **Permissions**  
3️⃣ Scroll to **Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)** → Click Edit  
4️⃣ Add this JSON:
```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"]
  }
]
```
✅ Now, any website can fetch files from your S3 bucket using JavaScript.

💡 **Tip**: Replace `"*"` with specific domains like `["https://mywebsite.com"]` for better security.

---

### **🎯 Summary**
✔ **Public Access** → Enable in **Bucket Settings** (Use with Caution)  
✔ **IAM Permissions** → Use for **secure role-based access**  
✔ **Presigned URLs** → **Temporary access** links for security  
✔ **CORS Policy** → **Allow web apps to fetch files** from your bucket
