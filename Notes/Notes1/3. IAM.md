### **IAM (Identity and Access Management):**

**IAM** is a service in **AWS** that helps you manage access to your AWS resources securely. It allows you to control **who** can access **what** resources and **how** they can interact with them.

With IAM, you can:
- **Create users**: You can create individual users and give them specific permissions to access resources.
- **Create groups**: Group users together and assign permissions to the group, making it easier to manage permissions for multiple users.
- **Assign roles**: Roles allow you to define a set of permissions and assign them to AWS services or users, enabling secure access without sharing credentials.
- **Set permissions**: You can use **policies** to define what actions are allowed or denied for users, groups, or roles.

**Use Case:**
For example, you might have a developer who needs full access to **S3 buckets** but limited access to **EC2 instances**. With IAM, you can create a policy that grants these specific permissions and attach it to the developerâ€™s user account.

IAM helps ensure that only authorized users and services can access your AWS resources, enhancing security and compliance.
